LawlJSON 
========

LawlJSON is a light JSON implementation for C++ distributed under the FreeBSD license, e.g. use it to your hearts financial content. It is designed to be as simple as possible and to use pre-existing infrastructure such as the STL. For this reason it is an excellent choice for projects that need a quick file import and export. 

That said, it lacks some features found in other JSON libraries such as callback based object loading or custom data structures for everything. 

I don't care. 

I make games and all I ever wanted was a simple JSON library.

Enjoy :)
